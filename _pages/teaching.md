My teaching philosophy is rooted in three principles: **inclusive education**, **applied and research-driven learning**, and **developing critical thinkers who can use informatics and AI to improve health outcomes in diverse communities**. My goal as an educator is to empower students—not only to master technical content, but also to apply these skills to real-world public health and clinical challenges, especially those affecting underserved populations.

## 1. Creating Inclusive, Supportive, and Accessible Learning Environments

My experiences teaching and mentoring students from diverse academic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds have shaped my commitment to inclusive pedagogy. I believe that effective learning occurs when students feel respected, supported, and able to express their perspectives. To build this environment, I incorporate:

*   **Multiple modes of instruction** (hands-on exercises, visual explanations, coding labs, case studies) to accommodate different learning styles.
*   **Transparent course design** with clear expectations, structured weekly modules, and scaffolded assignments.
*   **Opportunities for peer support and collaboration**, which help students build confidence and strengthen their communication skills.
*   **Open dialogue about challenges** in learning AI, statistics, or informatics tools—normalizing struggle as part of the process.

In health informatics, students often come from varied backgrounds (public health, computer science, nursing, medicine). I design my courses so that all students—regardless of prior technical experience—can meaningfully participate and succeed.

## 2. Teaching Through Real-World, Applied, and Data-Driven Problem Solving

I view health informatics as an inherently applied discipline that becomes meaningful only when connected to real-world problems. In my courses, students engage directly with:

*   **Electronic health records (EHR) datasets**
*   **De-identified clinical notes and NLP tasks**
*   **Machine learning models for risk prediction**
*   **Case studies on cancer screening, obesity treatment, or chronic disease management**
*   **Walk-throughs of target trial emulation frameworks**
