I have a strong computer science background complemented by two years of postdoctoral training in health informatics, where I was specifically trained to apply advanced computational methods to solve practical clinical problems through close collaboration with clinicians.

My research leverages real-world data from EHR and claims databases to generate real-world evidence that informs clinical decision-making. I have published across three complementary dimensions as the first author: (1) evidence-finding clinical studies (e.g., JAMA Oncology), (2) applications of informatics to address real-world healthcare challenges (e.g., JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics), and (3) methodological innovations proposing new techniques (e.g., IEEE JBHI, Journal of Biomedical Informatics).

Methodologically, my work emphasizes causal inference and machine learning approaches—including temporal modeling, reinforcement learning, and causal learning—for risk prediction, treatment effect estimation, target trial emulation, and clinical decision support in diverse healthcare domains, with applications spanning oncology, obesity, and diabetes.
