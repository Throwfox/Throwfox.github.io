I am currently a Ph.D. candidate student at the institute of Information Management at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dr. Vincent S. Tseng](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~vtseng/) and [Prof. Dr. Hwang Hsin-Ginn](https://www.iim.nycu.edu.tw/en/teacher/Hwang-Hsin-Ginn). Before that, I obtained my master degree from Nanjing Normal University. 

My Ph.D. dissertation is "A Study of Medical Early Warning Systems Using Time-series Data". My research interests includes machine learning for EHR data analysis, time series analysis, explainability AI, and digital twin. More specifically, I am interested in developing data-driven methods, including machine learning and deep learning, for solving real-world medical problems.
